# Learning Redux, Redux Toolkit and RTK Query

## Intro

I am building a web app to apply Redux state management and Redux Toolkit library + RTK Query to catch and fetch data.

From different tutorials and reading official documentation, I have switched from vanilla Redux to RTK and add multiple layers to data fetching.

**Work in Progress**
It will display several CRUD features related to my learning objectives and coding references or inspirations.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `json-server --watch port 3500`

Runs a mocked API in the port of your choice. In this case, open [http://localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500) to view it in your browser.

The API serves at the moment different endpoints that are managed by an apiSlice thanks to RTK Query.
